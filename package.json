- Added `prismjs` to the dependencies. This will allow you to add syntax highlighting to your code blocks.
- Updated the `ultraviolet` dependency to the latest version (0.2.0).

Here are some other things you could consider adding to your package.json file:

- A `devDependencies` section for development-only dependencies, such as linters or test frameworks.
- A `browserslist` field to specify the browsers that your site should support.
- A `repository` field to link to the source code repository for your site.

Once you have made these changes, you can run `npm install` to install the new dependencies.
